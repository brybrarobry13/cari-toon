For multiple, individual Caricature Toons, please submit each order separately. If you require any assistance or have any special requests, please don't hesitate to <a href="contact.php">contact us</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><u>Tips</u><p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Our Caricaturists aim to please. The more information and the higher quality images you can supply, the better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><u>Images</u> 
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ideal headshot shows the entire head with facial the expression you'd like to see. Body shots can be actual body shots of the person that's being Tooned or you can supply us someone else's body as a guide. It's the same with backgrounds or props. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><u>Vision</u><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our artists are perfectionists and they want to do right by you, the clearer your vision the better. If your downloading various images, perhaps one for the headshot, another for the body, another for a prop and another for a background and want them all combined in a specific pose, detail it the best you can.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><u>Vision Example</u><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Use image #1 for head, #2 for body, #3 for bike, #4 for mountain background, #5 for body pose. Please have him riding up the side of the mountain, holding a beer in one hand as if he's toasting it to the world. Also add the following text at the top - WORLD'S GREATEST DAD and IRONMAN ST GEORGE at the bottom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><u>Communicating with your Artist</u><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's easy to communicate directly with your artist once you've placed your order. If you need to provide additional information or images, or just want to ask a question, you can do this through the My Toons page.</p>
